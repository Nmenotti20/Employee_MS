### Installation

To install this application, you will need first have a code editor, and and have already downloaded and installed MySQL workbench ![https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). Next you would clone the repository ![(https://github.com/Nmenotti20/Employee_MS.git)]((https://github.com/Nmenotti20/Employee_MS.git) to your local machine. Open the repo in your code editor.  Next open the "schema.sql" file in MySQL Workbench. 

In the terminal, input "node server.js" to run the program, and follow the instructions given in the terminal by using the up and down arrows to navigate to your desired selection. If you would like to exit the program, please select "CANCEL" or you may use "control" + "c" simultaneously to end the MySQL server connection.

The application should prompt the user to select from one of the following actions to take: "SHOW all EMPLOYEES", "SHOW all DEPARTMENTS", "SHOW all ROLES", "ADD a NEW EMPLOYEE", "ADD a NEW DEPARTMENT", "ADD a NEW ROLE", "EDIT an EMPLOYEE ROLE", and "CANCEL". Upon selection "SHOW all EMPLOYEES", the user will then see displayed in the terminal a table with current employee data, and will be prompted for the next action to take. Upon selecting, "SHOW all DEPARTMENTS", or "SHOW all ROLES", the user will see displayed in the terminal a table for DEPARTMENTS and ROLES respectively. Upon choosing "ADD a NEW EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, or ROLE", the user will be prompted with a series of questions to answer relavant to the data needed to add a new record to that respective table. Upon selecting "EDIT an EMPLOYEE ROLE", the user will be prompted with a series of questions relevant to making a change to an employees role assignment in the employee table. Upon selecting "CANCEL", the user will disconnect from the MySQL server exit the application in the terminal.
